The Convexus SDK is separate from the Convexus protocol. It is designed to assist developers when interacting with the protocol in any environment that can execute JavaScript, such as websites or node scripts. With the SDK, you can manipulate data that has been queried from the EVM using libraries that assist with several needs, such as data modeling and protection from rounding errors.

# Installation

To interact with the SDK - we recommend installing though the npm package

```javascript
npm i --save-dev @convexus/sdk
npm i --save-dev @convexus/sdk-core
```

# Usage

```javascript
import { Pool } from '@convexus/sdk'
```

# Next Steps

Once your setup is operationnal, you can move to [**Creating a Pool Instance**](/sdk/pool/index.md).
