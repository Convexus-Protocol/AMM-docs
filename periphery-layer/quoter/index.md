# ðŸ“– Introduction

The `Quoter` contract works similarly to the `SwapRouter` contract. It exposes methods which allows getting the expected amount out or amount in for a given swap **without executing the swap**.

# **Tokens Swap**

The `Quoter` is able to give a quote for swapping two tokens thanks to the [SwapRouter `exactInput*/exactOuput* methods`](/periphery-layer/swaprouter/index.md). It supports multiple ways of quotations, depending of the user needs:

- [`quoteExactInputSingle`](#quoterquoteexactinputsingle): Returns the amount out received for a given exact input but for a swap of a single pool
- [`quoteExactInput`](#quoterquoteexactinput): Returns the amount out received for a given exact input swap without executing the swap
- [`quoteExactOutputSingle`](#quoterquoteexactoutputsingle): Returns the amount in required to receive the given exact output amount but for a swap of a single pool
- [`quoteExactOutput`](#quoterquoteexactoutput): Returns the amount in required for a given exact output swap without executing the swap
